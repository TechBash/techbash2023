## Abstract

It can be overwhelming to take a legacy monolith and split it into microservices, especially if the code seems messy. However, conversations with techies and non-techies over policies and process through an exercise called Event Storming can help ease your migration from a monolith to microservices. In this session, you will learn about Event Storming in the context of breaking down a legacy monolith eCommerce system into microservices.

## Word of Warning

If you are doing **simple** CRUD apps or building **simple** business solutions, then these solutions are overkill.
